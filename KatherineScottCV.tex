\textit{Analysis Team Lead}%
        \hfill \textbf{Feb 2018 to Present}  \\

\href{http://www.3can.com}{3Scan} makes an advanced robotic imaging system called a \href{https://youtu.be/GBj9hTrN0Yk}{Knife Edge Scanning Microscope (KESM)}. The KESM is able to serially image fixated and stained tissue volumes of up to 2x2x2cm at sub-micron resolution; creating a petabyte-scale voxel dataset. My job at 3Scan involved running the team that makes sense of these data sets, and to empower biologists and researchers to use our data. Due to the small team size at 3Scan (maximum three reports) this role allowed me to be more hands on and I wrote code on a more regular basis.
\begin{outerlist}
\item My primary focus at 3Scan was building out and validating 3Scan's Vascular Fingerprint Product (VFP) Beta. This product allowed researchers to send 3Scan whole india-ink stained mouse brains which were then imaged and analyzed to quantify the brain's vasculature and make it interpretable via a web portal. 
\item At 3Scan my software engineering was focused on building the java back-end for cleaning, segmenting, and visualizing voxel brain vasculature data. This included building bespoke image artifact removal tools, designing a segmentation pipeline, developing reduction operations to quantify volumes of vasculature, and validating the results. 
\item To validate our work and train our deep learning models I spent a great deal of time working with our in-house pathologist to create a \href{http://www.3scan.com/open-data/}{baseline dataset} and then training crowd labor to replicate the annotation results. These painstakingly annotated images were then used to develop both traditional image processing and deep learning based approaches for detecting tissue, removing imaging artifact, and segmenting vasculature. A good summary of this work can be found in \href{https://github.com/osbd/osbd-2018/raw/master/proceedings/S09204_4274.pdf}{this paper}.

\href{http://www.planet.com}{Planet} is the world's largest earth imaging satellite company by number of satellites. I started at Planet as a senior software engineer and then created and lead the ten person image analytics team. This role included managing day-to-day engineering operations, plotting the technical direction of the group across the product engineering organization, and recruiting the ten person team. 
\\
\begin{outerlist}
\item While at Planet I built and managed the 10+ person Image Analytics team an plotted the technical direction of the analytics component of Planet's Platform for Analytics. At Planet, the image analytics team owns all aspects of deep learning data collection, data annonation, image processing, remote sensing, machine learning, an deep learning.  
\item During the winter/spring of 2017 I executed \href{https://www.kaggle.com/c/planet-understanding-the-amazon-from-space}{Planet's Kaggle data science competition} from the concept phase through execution in a compressed two-month time frame. For this project I built a 100,000+ image data set from scratch demonstrating environmental challenges in the Amazon basin. To accomplish this project I had to quickly build a large imagery data set and have it exhaustively labeled using CrowdFlower, and then package the results in a manner that could be used by others in a data science competition.   
\item I created Planet's cloud (as in actual clouds) deep learning model and deployed it in our image processing pipeline. This quick and simple deep learning model was able to reduce our pipeline rectification compute costs by up to fifty percent and saves the company million of dollars. 
\item I prototyped an on-satellite machine learning model to identify cloudy images and deprioritize their download (that's right, I've done machine learning in space). This system worked as a small C implementation of integral images and support vector machine on constrained satellite hardware to identify extremely cloudy images. The system used data from my pipeline cloud detection deep learning model to automatically build and train models on a per-satellite basis.

        \textit{U.S. Army Research Development and Engineering Command (RDECom)} \\
        Developed a live fire training system to supplant existing military shoot houses by replacing traditional targets with synthetic augmented reality characters. This system uses a pose determination system comprised of multiple inertial measurement systems and video-based augmented reality techniques. The vision system uses traditional ``barcode'' fiducials as truth points to help estimate the positions of natural image features. Natural features are mapped between the barcode truth points to provide complete training area map coverage. The inertial measurement system is used to support the visual system when low lighting or fast motion prevent the acquisition of robust camera data.

        \textit{U.S. Research Development and Engineering Command (RDECom)} \\
        Vigilance is a real-time, network-based, database driven system for monitoring secure facilities and roadsides for suspicious and hostile activity. For fixed cameras Vigilance uses a hybrid background modeling system that incorporates multi-layer background codebooks models and frame differencing. Feature tracking is assisted by per feature extended Kalman filtering. Once tracking is accomplished features are characterized as either humans, vehicles, or objects using boosted Haar-like classifiers and descriptive statistics like aspect ratio, size, and motion. Once features are classified the system then looks for anomalous events like loitering, the dropping off and picking up of objects, and motion that deviates from a statistical model. Data about the image features and actions within each scene is recorded in an XML schema, which is then uploaded with the image to a PostgresSQL database.

  			Working with Dr. \href{http://www.med.umich.edu/meded/about/profiles/Andreatta.htm}{Prof. Pamela Andreatta} at the University of Michigan Clinical Simulation Center, I researched and designed a low-cost medical mannequin system for the training of the three main causes of battlefield death (tension pneumothorax, hemorrhage, and obstructed air way / cricothyrotomy). The proposed system would use augmented reality technology to perform tracking of the medical mannequin while displaying training information and medical imagery to the trainee. In addition to the core augmented reality system, we also proposed a tool and hand tracking methodology that could recognize and evaluate common life saving tasks using multi-view shape context to analyze the  user's hand configuration and common tools. The hand configuration, pose, motion, and tool selected, in conjunction with the simulation context, were to be used within an unsupervised, boosted, learning system to perform objective assessment of the combat life saver's capabilities.

\item \textbf{Augmented Reality Maintenance Assistant}%
        \hfill \textbf{Phase I}\\
        \textit{U.S. Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM)} \\
				Using Cybernet's proprietary touch screen tablet PC platform SWMA I created an augmented reality maintenance device that projects existing interactive electronic technical manuals onto maintenance area of the Light Armored Vehicle 25 (LAV25). The system performs tracking within the LAV25 using optical fiducials, and provides annotation, repair, and condition based maintenance data overlaid on the touchscreen tablet's screen. Using the system a maintainer could point the tablet�s rear mounted camera at a vehicle are, view registered annotation data on a live video feed, and then access relevant technical manual data. The user could then perform repairs using the tablet�s integrated repair and diagnostic tools.
