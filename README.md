CV /Resume
======

This is a latex repository for my CV, resume, and other stuff.

See the makefile for list of instructions.

Feel free to copy this as a template.

*NOTE* 

* I only keep the CV up to date, the resume can be regenerated as needed.
* As such [this document](https://github.com/kscottz/resume/blob/master/KatherineScottCVSmall.pdf) is probably the one you want.
* On Ubuntu open from the command line with `xdg-open <filename.pdf>`
